# Chaotic Nonlinear Dynamics and Fractals

[Interactive visualization](https://marl0ny.github.io/fractals-classical-mechanics) of the fractal generated by solving thousands of chaotic double pendulum systems simultaneously. In this visualization, the colours encode the angular separations of the pendulums. The x-axis and y-axis of this fractal plot correspond to the initial angular separations of each double pendulum.

Based on the video [The Double Pendulum Fractal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7JK4Ht8k8M") by [Sam Maksimovich](https://github.com/maksimovichsam), as well as the blog post [Double Pendulum Chaos](https://www.mitchr.me/SS/doublePendulum/index.html) by [Mitch Richling](https://github.com/richmit).
